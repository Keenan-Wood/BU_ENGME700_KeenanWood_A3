Apologies for the unfinished code analysis.

Code Heirarchy:

The module Solver.py contains the method
hyperelastic_solver()

which depends on the modules

assemble_global and discretization.

The module assemble_global.py contains 3 methods

global_stiffness(), global_traction(), and global_residual()
